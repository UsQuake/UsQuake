## 👋 Hi, I'm Ssong

I study how system execution and model structure can be **represented,
maintained, and analyzed**.  
My work focuses on:

- **Runtime memory management & consistency** across heterogeneous accelerators  
- **IR-based translation and pipeline-level understanding**  
- ⏱️ **Execution-time consistency analysis across system layers**  
- **Self-supervised representation learning for IR and system behavior analysis**

## ⏱️ Recent Focus: System-level Execution Flow Representation

I've been examining **execution flows encountered during
system-level integration work**, converting rendering and compute behaviors into
**graph-structured representations** for deeper analysis.

I'm interested in turning complex behavioral patterns into reliable
representations that improve both efficiency and system consistency.
