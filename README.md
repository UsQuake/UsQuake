## 👋 Hi, I'm Ssong

I study how system execution and model structure can be **represented,
maintained, and analyzed**.  
My work focuses on:

- **Runtime memory management & consistency**
- **IR-level representation and lightweight program summarization**
- **Execution-time consistency analysis across software layers**
- **Representation-driven analysis for systems and ML**

I’m interested in turning patterns of  complex behaviors into reliable representations
that improve both efficiency and consistency.
