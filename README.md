## 👋 Hi, I'm Ssong

I study how system ⚙️ behavior can be ✏️*represented* and 🌊*flowed*.

### 😆 I'm interested in:

- how to make system 🗑️ forget.
  + like, [**♻ garbage collection**](https://shipilev.net/jvm/diy-gc/) in storage & memory.
- how to make system learn 🔡 representation and 🦠 evolution itself.
  + like,  **[self-supervised learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfqWt1rk7TE)** and **[evolutionary learning](http://nature.com/articles/s42256-020-00267-x)**.
- how to make system (﹙˓ 📶 ˒﹚) communicates and feedbacks one another. 
  + like, [***protocols*** for web](https://protobuf.dev/), [***mmio*** communication](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3620665.3640389).
- how to make system 💾 memorizes and 🎲 simulates.
  + like, [non-generative ***🤖 turing-complete*** systems](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-57183-0).


### 🤔 I'm currently focusing on:

I’m researching ***how to 🛠️ debug 🎨 graphical systems(GUI apps and games)***:
 - Implement 🔴REC & ▶ record & replay with RenderDoc based on GPU compiler.
 - Encode 🎬 framebuffer with **abstraction** methods(hashing, metadata).
