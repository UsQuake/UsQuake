## 👋 Hi, I'm Ssong

I study how system ⚙️ behavior can be ✏️*represented* and 🌊*flowed*.

### 😆 I'm interested in:

- ⚙️ **Runtime [memory management](https://shipilev.net/jvm/diy-gc/) & [shared memory consistency](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3620665.3640389)** across memorization system layers.
  + How the systems memorize.
- (﹙˓ 📶 ˒﹚) **[Communications](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-57183-0)** between different systems.
  + Seeing communications between 🧠 brain and 🤖 turing-machine.
- ***Non-generative AIs,*** Like, 📝 **[self-supervised learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfqWt1rk7TE)** and 🦠 **[evolutionary learning](http://nature.com/articles/s42256-020-00267-x)**
  + How to represent and evolve communications.

### 🤔 I'm currently focusing on:

I’m researching ***how to 🔧debug 🎨graphics(UI)***:
 - Automation of debugging **GPU compiler** during lowering.
 - Encode framebuffer with **abstraction** methods(hashing, encoding, metadata).
