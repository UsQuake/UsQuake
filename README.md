## 👋 Hi, I'm Ssong

I study how system ⚙️ behavior can be **represented,
maintained, and analyzed**.

## 😆 I'm interested in:

- **Runtime [memory management](https://shipilev.net/jvm/diy-gc/) & [shared memory consistency](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3620665.3640389)** across devices 
- **[IR/Metadata based translation](https://github.com/hzfsls/evo-c2rust-v2) and [pipeline-level understanding](https://docs.mesa3d.org/drivers/llvmpipe.html)**  
- ⏱️ **[Execution-time consistency analysis](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~rgu/publications/cav18-yuan.pdf) across system layers**  
- **[Self-supervised learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfqWt1rk7TE) for IR and [(dynamic)system](https://github.com/CubbyFlow/CubbyFlow) analysis**

## ⏱️ Recent Focus: System-level Execution Flow Representation  

I've been examining **execution flows encountered during
system-level integration work**, organizing rendering and compute behaviors into
**graph-structured, DAG-like representations** for deeper analysis.

I'm interested in turning complex behavioral patterns into reliable
representations that improve both efficiency and system consistency.
