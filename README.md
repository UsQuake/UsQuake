## 👋 Hi, I'm Ssong

I study how system ⚙️ behavior can be **represented,
maintained, and analyzed**.

## 😆 I'm interested in:

- ⚙️ **Runtime [memory management](https://shipilev.net/jvm/diy-gc/) & [shared memory consistency](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3620665.3640389)** across devices
  + How computation stays correct across layers, devices, and schedules.
- 🧱 **[IR/Metadata based translation](https://github.com/hzfsls/evo-c2rust-v2) and [pipeline-level understanding](https://docs.mesa3d.org/drivers/llvmpipe.html)**
  + Understanding compute/graphic pipelines as state transitions, not code.
- ⏱️ **[Execution-time consistency analysis](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~rgu/publications/cav18-yuan.pdf) across system layers**
  + Seeing timing, ordering, and side-effects as structural invariants.
- 🔁 **[Self-supervised learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfqWt1rk7TE) for IR and [(dynamic)system](https://github.com/CubbyFlow/CubbyFlow) analysis**
  + Using ML to understand how a given system flows(runs) and evolve rather than existing representation.

## 🧩 Current Focus — Execution as World Model 

I’m exploring how system-level execution (rendering, compute, drivers) forms graph-structured, particle-like dynamics:

 - turning complex behaviors into DAG-like flow representations
 - testing metamorphic stability, invariance, and convergence patterns
 - treating IR + runtime patterns like a tiny dynamic system we can model

Ultimately, I’m trying to represent “how a system moves” —not just what it computes.
