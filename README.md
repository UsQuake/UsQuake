## 👋 Hi, I'm Ssong

I study how system ⚙️ behavior can be ✏️*represented* and 🌊*flowed*.

### 😆 I'm interested in:

- 💾 how to make system memorize.
  + like, ⚙️ **runtime [memory management](https://shipilev.net/jvm/diy-gc/) & [shared memory consistency](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3620665.3640389)** across memorization(cache, memory, storage media) systems.
- (﹙˓ 📶 ˒﹚) how to make system communicates. 
  + like, web-based specification, compilation/transpilation between PLs, [interfaces between 🧠 brain and 🤖 turing-machines](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-57183-0).
- how to make system learn representation and evolve itself.
  + like, 📝 **[self-supervised learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfqWt1rk7TE)** and 🦠 **[evolutionary learning](http://nature.com/articles/s42256-020-00267-x)**.

### 🤔 I'm currently focusing on:

I’m researching ***how to 🔧debug 🎨graphical systems(GUI apps and games)***:
 - Automation of debugging **GPU compiler** during lowering.
 - Encode framebuffer with **abstraction** methods(hashing, encoding, metadata).
