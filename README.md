## 👋 Hi, I'm Ssong

I study how system ⚙️ behavior can be **represented,
maintained, and analyzed**.

## 😆 I'm interested in:

- 🧱 **Runtime [memory management](https://shipilev.net/jvm/diy-gc/) & [shared memory consistency](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3620665.3640389)** across devices
  + How computation stays correct across layers, devices, and schedules.
- 🔁 **[Code translation](https://github.com/hzfsls/evo-c2rust-v2)**
  + Understanding compute/graphic pipelines as state transitions, not code.
- ⚙️ **[Execution consistency analysis](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~rgu/publications/cav18-yuan.pdf) across system layers**
  + Seeing timing, ordering, and side-effects as structural invariants.
- 📝 **[Self-supervised learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfqWt1rk7TE)**
  + Using ML to understand how a given system flows(runs) and evolve rather than existing representation.

## 🧩 I'm currently focusing on:

I’m researching how to debug game:
 - Automation of debugging **GPU compiler** during lowering.
 - Extraction of glitches with **VLMs**.
 - Encode framebuffer with abstraction(hashing, encoding, metadata).
